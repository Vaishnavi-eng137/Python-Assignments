## Assignment Part-1
# --Python is case sensitive 
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
# -- Python is a general-purpose language because it can be used to create a variety of different programs such as procedural programming ,
oop, functional programming and isn't specialized for any specific problems.It is considered as high-level programming language because
it is easy for humans to understand as it is written in human readable form. (just like english language following some syntax)

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
# -- Python is called a Dynamically typed language because interpreter in python assigns type of the variables at runtime
only based on the variable's value at the time.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
# pros -- 1. Design philosophy i.e It's very easy to learn and understand (simple,elegant and probably the easiest language to learn),
             The code is always well indented.
          2. Batteries included (the language comes with several built-in data types and functions and operators)
          3. Extensive Libraries/Community (awesome community and Support of various python libraries available like numpy, 
             pandas which are very much helpful in exploratory data analysis)
          4. General purpose
          5. Interpreted Language(Python executes every individual line in the code one by one as it’s an interpreted language.
             When it encounters an error, it reports the error and doesn’t proceed with the execution of the code. 
             It also simplifies debugging as it shows only a single error even if there are multiple errors.)
# cons -- 
        '''
          1. Slower than compiled languages like C, C++, C#  (solution n-dimensional array in numpy library of python)
          2. High memory consumption or poor memory efficiency (To make it simple for the developer, Python needs a lot of memory space;)
          3. Weak in mobile computing (due its high memory usage and slow speed, it is generally not used for frontend programming or mobile app development.)
          4. Runtime Errors (The data types of variables in Python can change suddenly, as it is a dynamically typed language. A variable holding a string may 
             contain an integer later, and this can lead to runtime errors.)
          5. Database Access(Though it is easy to program with Python, the database access layer is underdeveloped compared to other technologies like ODBC.)'''

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
# -- There are various domains where we can use python some of them are :
    1. Data science
    2. Automation
    3. Machine learning/Arificial intelligence
    4. Application Development
    5. Audio/Vedio Applications
    6. Desktop GUI / Gaming 

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
# -- They are containers for future use or a name given to a specific memory location.
# -- Python has no command for declaring a variable.
# -- A variable is created the moment we first assign a value to it.i.e (Dynamic typing),it does not support static typing
# declaring a variable x = 4 (variable should not start with any number or special character only _ is allowed)

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
# -- we can use input() function take an input from the user in Python

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
# -- String is the default data type of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function .

Q8. What is type casting?
# -- whenever we change the datatype like integer data type to string data type or so on 
# int(),str(),bool(),float() functions available for typecasting

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
# Yes we can take more than one input from the user .
# name1,name2 = input("enter two names: ").split() 
# print("first name:" name1)
# print("second name:" name2)


Q10. What are keywords?
# Certain words which are predefined and reserved in python that have special meanings and 
used by the compilers and interpreters through which they convert high level code into machine level code.
All the keywords in python are written in lower case except True and False.There are 33 keywords in python  eg. def,if,return,try,class,none,True

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
# No, We can not use keywords as a variable, we will get syntax error if we use keywords as varibale.

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
# Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
# we can throw some output in Python using print() function.

Q14. What are operators in Python?
# Assignment operator --> =,+=,-=,*=,/=,//=,**=,%=
# Numerical operators --> +,-,*,/,//,%,**
# Comparison operators --> <,>,<=,>=,==,!=
# logical operators --> and ,or,not
# Bitwise operators --> 
  Bitwise AND operator
  Bitwise OR operator
  Bitwise not operator
  Bitwise XOR operator
# Shift Operators: 
  Bitwise right shift
  Bitwise left shift
# Membership operators --> in , not in

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
# / is float multiplication(contains decimals) whereas // is integer multiplication(does not contain decimals)

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```
# print("iNeuron"*4)

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.

# a = int(input("write a number:"))
# print(a)
# if(a%2 == 0):
#    print("number is even")
# elif(a%2 != 0):
#    print("number is odd")

Q18. What are boolean operator?
# True,False are boolean operator

Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0  --> 1

0 and 0  --> 0

True and False and True --> False

1 or 0 or 0 --> 1
```
Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
# conditional statements are used to execute the specific block of code if the given condition is true or false.
# if , elif , else 

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
# If,elif,else statement is used in Python for decision-making i.e the program will evaluate test expression and
will execute the remaining statements only if the given test expression turns out to be true.
This allows validation for multiple expressions.

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
# age = int(input("write any age number : "))  
# if age >= 18:
#   print("I can vote")
# elif age < 18:
#   print("I can't vote")

Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
sum = 0
for items in numbers:  
    if items%2 == 0:
        sum += items

print(sum)

Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.

t1 = int(input("first number: "))
t2 = int(input("second number: "))
t3 = int(input("third numer: "))

if t1>t2 and t1>t3:
   print("greatest number:",t1)
elif t2>t3:
   print("greatest number:",t2)  
else:
   print("greatest number:",t3) 

Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
for nums in numbers:
   if nums%5 != 0:
      continue
   if nums%5 == 0 and nums>500:
      break
   elif nums%5 == 0 and nums>150:
      continue
   print(nums) 

print("out from for loop")
